# Project 2 - *Wordle*

Submitted by: **Sai Suhas Chekka**

**Wordle** is an app that challenges players to guess a five-letter word within six attempts. Each guess provides feedback: letters turn green if they are correct and in the right position, yellow if they are in the word but in the wrong position, and gray if they are not in the word at all. The game encourages logical deduction, vocabulary skills, and pattern recognition, making it both engaging and educational. 

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total
